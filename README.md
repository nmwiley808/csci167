# CSCI 167 – Introduction to Deep Learning  
**Fresno State | Computer Science**

This repository contains my coursework, notebooks, experiments, and projects for  
**CSCI 167: Introduction to Deep Learning** at **California State University, Fresno**.

The course provides an overview of machine learning with special attention to the concepts and algorithms underlying modern deep learning. Emphasis is placed on both theoretical foundations and hands-on experimentation using popular deep learning frameworks.
