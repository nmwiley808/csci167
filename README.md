## Course Description

CSCI 167 introduces the fundamental principles of machine learning and deep learning, including:

- Machine learning fundamentals  
- Logistic regression  
- Neural networks and backpropagation  
- Vanishing / diminishing gradients  
- Optimization techniques and normalization  
- Batch normalization  
- Residual Networks (ResNets)  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
- Experimental evaluation of deep learning models  

The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on experimentation using modern deep learning frameworks.

## How to Run Notebooks

Most assignments are completed using Jupyter Notebook.

To run locally:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Some experiments may require GPU acceleration for training deep learning models.
